### YouTube Clone Using the MERN

This is a **full-stack YouTube clone** built using **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack)**. The project allows users to **view and interact with videos**, including authentication, search, filters, and a video player page.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Home Page:** Includes a YouTube-style header, sidebar toggle, filters, and video thumbnails displaying title, thumbnail, channel name, and views.
- **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in via JWT, and access their profile after signing in.
- **Search & Filters:** A search bar for video titles and category-based filtering.
- **Video Player Page:** Displays a selected video along with title, description, channel info, likes/dislikes, and a comment section where users can add, edit, and delete comments.

#### **Setup Steps**:
1. Created a GitHub repo and initialized the project.
2. Set up the frontend with React using `npm create vite@latest`, installed dependencies, and cleaned up initial files.
3. Created a backend folder, initialized with `npm init -y`, installed required packages (`express`, `mongoose`), and built the `app.js` with necessary imports.

This project was built on **April 25, 2025**, for an **end-term exam**.
